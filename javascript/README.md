# JavaScript front-end

The "front-end" of Smooch is just a few files. There's some HTML, a
CSS file, and two JavaScript files.

## doll.js

This is the JavaScript for the viewer. It's all vanilla JavaScript,
no libraries or anything.

### the ghost canvas

I'm using a game coding technique called a "ghost buffer" to detect
what images are being clicked on.

I'll write a blog post soon explaining it in detail!

## setdata.js

This is mostly JSON representing the KiSS doll set's configuration,
generated by Haskell side of the app. This script is just two variable
declarations.

### kissJson

Here's JSON for a set with one object:

```(json)
{
  // the size of the play area
  "window_size": [
    700,
    430
  ],
  "objs": [
  // an object has an id number, a list of cels, and a
  // list of positions
    {
      "id": 0,
      "cells": [
      // a cell has a palette for the cel, the sets the cel
      // is visible in, a "fix" value indicating how many
      // time you need to click the cel before you can
      // drag it (usually 0 for clothes, a large number for
      // the body), a name, and how transparent it should be.
        {
          "palette": 0,
          "sets": [
            1,
            2,
            3,
            4,
            5,
            6,
            7,
            8,
            9
          ],
          "fix": 4000,
          "name": "aurora",
          "alpha": 0
        }
      ],
      "positions": [
        {
          "y": 0,
          "x": 0
        },
        {
          "y": 67,
          "x": 283
        },
        {
          "y": 67,
          "x": 283
        },
        {
          "y": 67,
          "x": 283
        },
        {
          "y": 67,
          "x": 283
        },
        {
          "y": 67,
          "x": 283
        },
        {
          "y": 67,
          "x": 283
        },
        {
          "y": 67,
          "x": 283
        },
        {
          "y": 67,
          "x": 283
        },
        {
          "y": 67,
          "x": 283
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### celJson

This is only the cel parts of the JSON. The first object is the cel, the
list after it is the x and y offsets.

This could be improved greatly!! Instead of a list of an object and an
array, this really ought to be an object with two objects nested
inside. If you'd like to fix that, though, the code to generate the JSON
is in the Haskell part of the repo.

```(json)
 [
    {
      "palette": 0,
      "sets": [
        1,
        2,
        3,
        4,
        5,
        6,
        7,
        8,
        9
      ],
      "fix": 0,
      "name": "fuzzskir",
      "alpha": 0
    },
    [
      0,
      0
    ]
  ]
```
